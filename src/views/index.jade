        h2 what is the federation?
        p A loving term for three awesome decentralized social media projects.
        small TODO: link post where it was mentioned for the first time, give credit, and longer explanation. Sorry this site renewal is under construction.

        h3 what is diaspora*?
        p Diaspora* is an awesome decentralized open source social network full of really cool people. Instead of being owned and controlled by a single corporation, all the pods (servers) in the diaspora* network are totally independent and controlled usually by single individuals. The project, which is run by a community of volunteers, builds the software which is free to use by anyone. You can easily run a pod yourself too, or if you don't want to, check out some of the open pods listed here and go create an account!
        p
            a(href="https://diasporafoundation.org") Find out more about diaspora* from the official project pages.

        h3 what is friendica?
        p See http://friendica.com/

        h3 what is hubzilla?
        p See http://hubzilla.org/

        h2 what is this hub?
        p The statistics hub is a piece of software that automatically statistics from opt-in pods. The user and post count data here is opt-in for podmins and needs to be activated in pod settings. The idea is to generate some feel towards how many of us diasporians, friendicans and hubzillians there really are.
        p The code is <a href="https://github.com/jaywink/diaspora-hub">in GitHub</a> under AGPLv3. Please file bugs and ideas there if you want to - and of course pull request are welcome too.

        h3 can I get a copy of the data?
        p It's all available as JSON, feel free to use any data you want! I cannot guarantee the JSON will not change over time, though it should mostly stay stable. You can always let me know if you depend on some JSON feed and I'll make sure not to break it.
        p Here are the endpoints:

        p Please don't abuse these endpoints. They are refreshed <b>only once per day</b>, at 00:13 EET, so there is no need to bang them every 10 minutes for new data..

        h3 how do I get my instance listed?
        p For registering your pod with this hub, go to <code>https://the-federation.info/register/&lt;yourpod.tld&gt;</code>. After some seconds, you should see your pod added. After that, daily updates happen once per 24 hours (some minutes past midnight EET).

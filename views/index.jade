        h2 list of pods
        p Find more pods at <a href="http://podupti.me">podupti.me</a> and <a href="http://diapod.net/active">diapod.net</a>. This podlist will grow as the statistics feature becomes part of Diaspora.

        include podlist.jade
        
        p
            em.small Disclaimer: This podlist is in no way an official list of Diaspora pods. Also currently it does not contain even a fraction of the pods in the Diaspora network. Due to the distributed way diaspora works, it is not possible to even make a list of all pods.

        h2 what hub?
        p The statistics hub is a piece of software that <a href="https://www.loomio.org/discussions/9190">was proposed</a> by <a href="https://iliketoast.net/u/jaywink">myself</a> as an official project podlist resource that would automatically pull in data from opt-in pods. The user and post count data here is opt-in for podmins and needs to be activated in pod settings. The idea is to generate some feel towards how many of us diasporians there really are.
        p The code is <a href="https://github.com/jaywink/diaspora-hub">in GitHub</a> under AGPLv3. Please file bugs and ideas there if you want to - and of course pull request are welcome too. This is very much work in progress.

        h3 how do I get my pod listed?
        p The statistics code has been <a href="https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/commit/0fb962cd1d942a04f3b58ed0174ba3eb7776b05f">merged</a> to develop branch, so if your pod runs that, you can just deploy the latest development code and then go to <code>https://&lt;yourpod.tld&gt;/statistics.json</code> to verify it works. If you want to report user and post counts, edit the <a href="https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/commit/0fb962cd1d942a04f3b58ed0174ba3eb7776b05f#diff-72093d13f77e805ad8de330c99e6c73eR195">relevant configuration</a> and restart your diaspora pod.
        p For registering your pod with this hub, go to <code>http://pods.jasonrobinson.me/register/&lt;yourpod.tld&gt;</code>. After some seconds, you should see your pod added. After that, daily updates happen once per 24h (some minutes past midnight EET).
        
        p For pods on stable releases you can either wait for a release (recommended) or merge in <a href="https://github.com/jaywink/diaspora/commit/2c83d0e846c709647d7308cc478ebc33c90d8a80">this commit</a>.

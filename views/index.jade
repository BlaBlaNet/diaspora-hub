        h1 diaspora* statistics hub

        h2 list of pods
        p Find more pods at <a href="http://podupti.me">podupti.me</a> and <a href="http://diapod.net/active">diapod.net</a>. This podlist will grow as the statistics feature becomes part of Diaspora.

        include podlist.jade
        
        p
            em.small Disclaimer: This podlist is in no way an official list of Diaspora pods. Also currently it does not contain even a fraction of the pods in the Diaspora network. Due to the distributed way diaspora works, it is not possible to even make a list of all pods.
            
        h2 here be graphs
        include charts.jade

        h2 what hub?
        p The statistics hub is a piece of software that <a href="https://www.loomio.org/discussions/9190">was proposed</a> by <a href="https://iliketoast.net/u/jaywink">myself</a> as an official project podlist resource that would automatically pull in data from opt-in pods. The user and post count data here is opt-in and <a href="https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/pull/4602">is currently waiting</a> for code cleanup and a pull to the diaspora* code. The idea is to generate some feel towards how many of us diasporians there really are.
        p Since placing this hub under the project didn't really gain much excitement, I decided to just do it anyway. The code is <a href="https://github.com/jaywink/diaspora-hub">in GitHub</a> under AGPLv3. Please file bugs and ideas there if you want to - and of course pull request are welcome too. This is very much work in progress and a bit ugly :)

        h3 how do I get my pod listed?
        p Currently it is best to wait for the merge (follow <a href="https://iliketoast.net/u/jaywink">me</a> for news on that). Once the code is in develop branch, it can be safely merged in as single commits for those not wanting to wait until a release. I will be also adding to the list pods without statistics in the future, though of course any counts for those pods will be missing. 

        h3 under the hood
        p Full stack JavaScript power:
